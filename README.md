# Random Search

By now you have use Grid search hyper-parameters and maybe it become the de facto for you since you inherited from your lecturer. God! if you ask me? inherited knowledge is hard to convenience otherwise to mention few i.e religion, but am here to show you have random search can out perform Grid search.
Random search are more efficient than grid search for hyper-parameter optimization  in several learning algorithm cases on many data sets as shown in Journal of Machine Learning Research 13 (2012) 281-305. 
In this research paper the analysis of the hyper-parameter response funtion suggests that random search are more efficient because not all hyper-parameters are equally important to tune which in Grid search all the hyper-parameter are equally important to tune thus allocate too many trials to the exploration of dimensions that even do not matter and thus suffer from poor coverage in dimensions that are important also require alot of computational resource to accomplish a task then random search found better models and require less computational resource.
